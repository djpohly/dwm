Notes:
- mon->clients is the tiling order
- mon->stack is the last-focused order
- restack() applies focus order as stacking order
- if focus follows mouse without raising windows, then selmon->sel is not
  necessarily the topmost window, but it is still the top of selmon->stack
- Idea: floating layer and tiled layer, and whichever is raised is entirely in front
- Window stacking order is preserved when unmapped
- Original restack: raise selected+floating, leave bar, stack tiled below bar,
  leave unselected+floating alone

Invariants (from setup return until cleanup call):
✓ mons != NULL
✓ selmon != NULL
✓ c->mon != NULL
✓ c in m->clients <=> c in m->stack
. window border = w == selmon->sel ? SchemeSel : SchemeNorm
. If selmon->sel != NULL then:
  ✓ !isurgent
  . ISVISIBLE
  . first in selmon->stack that ISVISIBLE
  . has X focus?

Function preconditions:
? restack(m): m != NULL
? restack(m): m->sel != NULL (i.e. has something ISVISIBLE)
? arrange(m): m != NULL
? arrange(m): m->sel != NULL (i.e. has something ISVISIBLE)

Function postconditions:
✓ createmon(...) != NULL
✓ dirtomon(...) != NULL
✓ recttomon(...) != NULL
✓ wintomon(...) != NULL
✓ mons->next != NULL => dirtomon(...) != selmon

✓ Expose events only happen for m->barwin
. selmon->sel has XInputFocus, _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW, WM_TAKE_FOCUS
. showhide is never called with m == NULL

. for all c in m->clients, c->mon == m
. for all c in m->stack, c->mon == m

? attachto(c, m): c->mon != m

For any monitor m,
✓ m->clients is NULL if and only if m->stack is NULL
✓ m->sel is in m->stack
  m->sel == NULL or ISVISIBLE(m->sel)
  m->sel is NULL only if nothing in m->stack ISVISIBLE

Interplay of ->sel and X focus?
c->win border is SchemeSel if and only if c == selmon->sel
selmon->sel == first of selmon->stack which ISVISIBLE?

drawbar(m) if any of these change:
✓ OR(m->clients->tags)
✓ selmon->sel->tags (m = selmon)
✓ OR(m->clients->isurgent)
✓ m->ltsymbol
✓ m->tagset[m->seltags]
✓ m->sel
✓ selmon->sel (m = selmon)
✓ m->sel->name
✓ m->sel->isfixed
✓ m->sel->isfloating
✓ m->barwin
✓ m->ww
✓ Expose event on m->barwin
✓ stext (m = selmon)

drawbar after any of the following:
✓ applyrules(c): drawbar(c->mon)
✓ attachto(new c, m): drawbar(m)
✓ attachto(c, NULL): drawbar(c->mon)
✓ createmon(): drawbar(ret)
✓ seturgent(c, x): drawbar(c->mon)
✓ updatetitle(c): drawbar(c->mon)

drawbars after any of the following (multiple m change):
✓ attachto(c, m)

drawbars() if any of these change:
✓ selmon
✓ lrpad

drawbars after any of the following:
✓ updatebars
✓ updategeom() only if ret==1

side effects:
- arrange: all c->[xywh] on m, moves windows
- arrangeall: all c->[xywh], moves windows
- showhide: applies size hints to all visible+floating c->[xywh] on m
- showhideall: applies size hints to all visible+floating c->[xywh]
- restack: NONE
- focus: selmon=c->mon, selmon->sel=c, selmon->stack order,
         unset c->isurgent, numlockmask, sets window border, input focus
  - focus(NULL) will never change selmon
- unfocus: sets input focus, NetActiveWindow
- switchmon: selmon if needed
- seturgent: c->isurgent
- tostacktop: c->mon->stack order
- toclienttop: c->mon->clients order
- updatenumlockmask: numlockmask
- grabbuttons: numlockmask
- drawbar: NONE
- sendevent: NONE
- setfocus: NONE
- applysizehints: changes [xywh] args by reference
- configure: NONE
- resizeclient: c->[xywh], moves window
- resize: c->[xywh] with hints, moves window
- tile: c->[xywh], moves windows
- monocle: c->[xywh], moves windows
- setfullscreen: c->isfullscreen, c->isfloating, c->bw
                 1: c->oldstate, c->oldbw, c->old[xywh], c->[xywh];
                 0: all c->[xywh] on c->mon

sendmon was used in:
- movemouse
- resizemouse
- tagmon

focus(c) does:
- setxfocus(c): XInputFocus, _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW, WM_TAKE_FOCUS
- setfocus(c): switch button grabs and border from selmon->sel to c
- selectmon(c->mon): selmon = c->mon
- seturgent(c, 0): invariant
- tostacktop(c)
- selmon->sel = c

focus(NULL) if no visible client on selmon:
- setxfocus(NULL): XInputFocus etc. to root
- selmon->sel = NULL

focus(NULL) if any visible clients on selmon:
- set c = first visible client on selmon
- focus(c)


arrange(m) should be called when any of these change:
- m->lt[m->sellt]
- m->clients
- m->clients[*]->next
- m->clients[*]->bw?
- m->clients[*]->tags
- m->clients[*]->isfloating
- m->tagset[m->seltags]
- m->nmaster
- m->w[xywh] (updatebarpos, updategeom)
- m->mfact

showhide(m) should be called when any of these change:
- m->clients[*]->tags
- m->clients[*]->isfloating
- m->tagset[m->seltags]

restack(m) should only be called when sel should be raised

Are barwins moved or resized when we updategeom?
